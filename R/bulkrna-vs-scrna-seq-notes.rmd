## Bulk RNA-Seq
- Gene Expression or quantificuation values averaged across cells
- Allow comparison of healthy vs sick patients
- Cell heterogeniety is masked

Processing
----------
1. Quality Control
2. Preprocessing
3. Map clean reads to genome or transcriptome
4. Assemble reads to transcript
5. Differential Expression analysis

## Single-Cel RNA-seq
- Individual cells, and expression of genes within these cells, hence allowing for segregation
- Identifies which genes are differential expressed within each cell
- Reveals heterogeneity

Downstream analysis:
1. Gene Functional Enrichment Analysis
2. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis
3. Cell clustering and Cell type annotation
